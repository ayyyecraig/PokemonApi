# Part One _nology USA Tech Test
To help show off your abilities, we would like you to build a
"Pokemon
" API.
 which allows developers to access
information about the pokemon universe. This should be a RESTful API using a language of your choice with
the following endpoints.

---
## During which we'd like you to highlight 5 examples of coding best-practices you would advocate to students.
-----
- GET /pokemon
- This should serve all the pokemon in a JSON arrray.
-------
- GET /pokemon/3
- This should serve only the pokemon matching this ID. e.g.
-----
{ id: 1, name:
"Bulbasaur
" }
----
-------
- Once
you
'
re done, deploy your Application to google cloud platform app engine standard environment.


- Please send a GitHub repository link and public url for your API. 


-----   
## Coding examples to clean professional code every student needs. The tips are also demonstrated and noted thru out the actual code as well! 

- Pseudo code to help keep track of the code you've written and how it was implemented; this helps future you read something long forgotten.

- Add comments to console.logs to easily spot your log! 

- Console.log every func and the data you're attempting to pull before moving on. 

- Always comment out or erase console.logs once it has fufilled it's purpose 

- Vs code has the extension "prettier"; makes for an ease when your code is a little out of line and un-readable. Left click, format document, and your code instantly is easier for you and every one else to read. While learning to write and read code; messy work will be your worst enemy, especially in languages like python!  Never leave code that serves no purpose ex: a function you didnt realized you didnt need and just commented it out.

- Working thru Github is a skill of its own and commits are very important. When working on projects big or small, commit early, commit often.
